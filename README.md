# Backend Component
## Overview
This is the backend component of our project, responsible for handling server-side logic, database interactions, and API endpoints.

## Hosted Location

The backend is hosted at [BookStoreðŸ‘†](https://book-store-management-kappa.vercel.app/) .

## Functionalities

The backend provides the following functionalities:
- Server-side logic execution
- Database interactions with MongoDB
- API endpoints for client-server communication

## Main Routes

The main routes of the backend are as follows:

- `/user`: Routes related to user authentication and user-specific operations.
- `/admin`: Routes for admin-related functionalities and operations.
- `/author`: Routes for author-specific functionalities and operations.

# Middleware

Middleware functions in the backend are used to intercept incoming HTTP requests and perform operations such as authentication, authorization, and request processing. Here are the middleware functions used in our project:

## Authentication Middleware

The `auth` middleware function is responsible for authenticating incoming requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It verifies the token provided in the request headers and sets the authenticated user's ID in the request object for further processing.

## Authorization Middleware

Authorization middleware functions, such as `isAdmin` and `isAuthor`, are used to restrict access to certain routes based on user roles.<br>
For example, `isAdmin` ensures that only admin users can access specific routes, while `isAuthor` restricts access to routes specific to authors.

- **isAdmin**: Ensures that the user is an admin before allowing access to certain routes.
- **isAuthor**: Restricts access to routes specific to authors, ensuring that the user is authorized as an author.

## Usage

To use these middleware functions in your routes, simply import them and include them as route handlers before the actual route logic. For example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { auth, isAdmin, isAuthor } = require('./middleware/auth');

const router = express.Router();

// Protected route accessible only to authenticated users
router.get('/protected', auth, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Protected route');
});

// Admin-only route
router.get('/admin', auth, isAdmin, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Admin route');
});

// Author-only route
router.get('/author', auth, isAuthor, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Author route');
});

module.exports = router;
```

# Bulk Email Notification Feature

## Overview
The bulk email notification feature allows sending notifications to all retail users about new book releases. To prevent overwhelming the email server and to comply with service provider limits, the feature implements a batching mechanism where emails are sent in batches with a delay between each batch.

## Implementation Details
The implementation of the bulk email notification feature involves the following steps:

1. **Fetch All Users**: Fetch all retail users from the database using the UserModel.
2. **Batching Users**: Divide the list of users into smaller batches to send emails in manageable chunks. The batch size is configured to limit the number of emails sent simultaneously.
3. **Sending Emails with Delay**: Iterate through each batch of users and send emails with a delay between each batch. This delay ensures that the email server is not overloaded and complies with the service provider's rate limits.
4. **Handling Rate Limit**: To prevent exceeding the service provider's rate limit, the feature sends emails in batches and waits for a specified delay between each batch. In this implementation, a delay of 60 seconds (1 minute) is used between batches to send up to batchSize emails.

## Code Snippet
```javascript
const UserModel = require("../models/user.model");
const cron = require("node-cron");

let allUsers = null;

const fetchAllUsers = async () => {
  console.log("Fetching all users from the database...");
  allUsers = await UserModel.find();
};

const bookLaunchNotification = async (message) => {
  try {
    // Fetch all users if not already fetched
    if (!allUsers) {
      await fetchAllUsers();
    }

    const batchSize = 2;
    const batches = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < allUsers.length; i += batchSize) {
      batches.push(allUsers.slice(i, i + batchSize));
    }

    let currentBatchIndex = 0;

    // Send emails for the first batch immediately
    sendEmailsWithDelay(message, batches[currentBatchIndex]);
    currentBatchIndex++;

    // Schedule cron job to send emails for remaining batches
    const cronJob = cron.schedule("* * * * *", () => {
      const currentBatch = batches[currentBatchIndex];
      if (currentBatch) {
        sendEmailsWithDelay(message, currentBatch);
        currentBatchIndex++;
      } else {
        cronJob.stop(); // Stop cron job when all batches are processed
      }
    });

    return { message: "Mail Sent To All Users Successfully" };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending notification:", error);
  }
};

const sendEmailsWithDelay = (message, users) => {
  try {
    console.log(message, "sent to -->", users.map((user) => user.email));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending emails:", error);
  }
};

module.exports = {
  bookLaunchNotification
};
```

# Book Purchase Function

This function handles the purchase of a book, updating relevant data in the database and sending email notifications to authors about the revenue generated.

## Input Parameters
- `req`: Request object containing information about the purchase request.
- `res`: Response object for sending HTTP responses.

## Steps
1. **Start Transaction**: Begin a session and start a transaction.
2. **Request Data**: Retrieve necessary data from the request object (`quantity`, `bookID`, `userId`).
3. **Validate Quantity**: Check if the quantity is a positive integer.
4. **Verify Book Existence**: Check if the requested book exists in the database.
5. **Calculate Total Price**: Calculate the total price of the purchase.
6. **Update Book Data**: Increment `sellCount` and decrement `quantityAvailable` of the book.
7. **Generate Purchase ID**: Generate a unique purchase ID based on the current date and existing purchase count.
8. **Create Purchase History**: Save a new purchase history record in the database.
9. **Commit Transaction**: Commit the transaction to save changes permanently.
10. **Update Author Revenue**: Iterate over each author of the purchased book, calculate their total revenue, and update their revenue records.
11. **Send Email Notifications**: Send email notifications to authors about the revenue generated.
12. **Handle Errors**: Handle any errors that occur during the process, retrying the transaction in case of a write conflict error.

## Error Handling
- If a write conflict error occurs, the transaction is retried.
- Other errors lead to aborting the transaction and returning an internal server error response.

## Response
- If successful, returns a 200 status with a success message and details of the purchase.
- In case of errors, returns an appropriate error status with error details.


# Revenue Calculation Logic
## Overview
The revenue calculation logic is responsible for computing the total monthly and yearly revenue generated from book purchases by an author. This logic is utilized after each book purchase to update the author's revenue records and send notifications accordingly.

## Implementation Details
The revenue calculation logic involves the following steps:

1. **Fetching Purchase History**: Retrieve purchase history records for the current month and year from the PurchaseHistoryModel.

2. **Calculating Total Revenue**: Calculate the total revenue generated by summing up the prices of all book purchases made by the author within the current month and year.

3. **Updating Author's Revenue**: Update the author's revenue records in the AuthorRevenueModel with the total revenue, current month revenue, and current year revenue.

4. **Sending Email Notification**: Send an email notification to the author, informing them about the revenue generated from book purchases.

## Code Snippet
```javascript
const calculateTotalMonthlyAndYearlyRevenue = async (authorId) => {
  try {
    // Fetch purchases made within the current month
    const purchasesThisMonth = await PurchaseHistoryModel.find({
      purchaseDate: {
        $gte: firstDayOfMonth,
        $lte: lastDayOfMonth
      }
    });

    // Fetch purchases made within the current year
    const purchasesThisYear = await PurchaseHistoryModel.find({
      purchaseDate: {
        $gte: firstDayOfYear,
        $lte: lastDayOfYear
      }
    });

    // Calculate total revenue from purchases made this month
    const totalMonthlyRevenue = purchasesThisMonth.reduce((acc, purchase) => {
      if (purchase.bookId.authors.includes(authorId)) {
        return acc + purchase.price;
      }
      return acc;
    }, 0);

    // Calculate total revenue from purchases made this year
    const totalYearlyRevenue = purchasesThisYear.reduce((acc, purchase) => {
      if (purchase.bookId.authors.includes(authorId)) {
        return acc + purchase.price;
      }
      return acc;
    }, 0);

    return { totalMonthlyRevenue, totalYearlyRevenue };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error calculating total monthly/yearly revenue:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```
## Calculating Total Revenue
The total revenue is updated by summing up the prices of current book purchase made by the user with the last total revenue.
